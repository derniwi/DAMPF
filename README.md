Network switch discovery tool based on
https://modlog.net/esp32-cdp-lldp-dhcp-third-edition/

Using ESP32, a TFT and currently an ENC28J60 Ethernet module

There is still some work to do but currently the tool is working.

Also some wiring diagrams should be added.
And of course photos of the tool itself. Currently there is only a loose breadboard wiring version available.
